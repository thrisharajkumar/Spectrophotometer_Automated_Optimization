The production optimization algorithm is designed to schedule over 250 lipstick shades efficiently. It considers the delta E values of the shades, which is calculated using the formula delta E = sqrt(a2+b2+L2). The algorithm also uses a greedy approach to schedule the shades from lightest to darkest and vice versa, based on the demand plan.
